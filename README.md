# SurvivorSimulator
This project uses Survivor data from True Dork Times to simulate the entire game, including tribal councils, alliances, vote-outs, and challenges. The goal is to let fans explore different outcomes, make fantasy picks, and predict winners for fun while celebrating Survivor strategy and gameplay!
